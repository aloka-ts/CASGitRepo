If you are compiling the servlets outside of VOB then change the ase.properties and the SRC parameter to the build dir (the INSTALLROOT when you compile ase). 

Also since the <if> task is not working with ant, please search for "if" and 
comment out the copying over of the src to dest. (As these are the same 
location no need to copy).
