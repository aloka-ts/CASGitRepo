/**
 * The JAIN(tm) SS7 Factory is a singleton class by which JAIN SS7 applications
 * can obtain a proprietary (Peer) JAIN SS7 Object.
 * The term 'peer' is Java nomenclature for "a particular platform-specific
 * implementation of a Java interface or API".
 * This term has the same meaning for the JAIN SS7 API specifications.<BR>
 * A Peer JAIN SS7 Object can be obtained from the JAIN SS7 Factory
 * by ethier :
 * <UL>
 *    <LI>instantiating a new Peer JAIN SS7 Object using the
 *        <a href="#createSS7Object(java.lang.String)">createSS7Object()</a> method, <B>or</B>
 *    <LI>selecting from the list of JAIN SS7 Objects returned by the
 *        <a href="#getJainObjectList()">getJainObjectList()</a> method.
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 *
 * The JAIN SS7 Factory utilises a naming convention defined for each JAIN SS7 API
 * to identify the location of proprietary JAIN SS7 Objects.<P>
 * Under this convention the <B>lower-level package structure and classname</B> of a Peer JAIN SS7 Object is
 * mandated by a convention defined within the JAIN SS7 API from which the Object
 * originates. <P>
 * For example: within the JAIN TCAP API, the lower-level package structure and classname of
 * a proprietary implementation of the <I>jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.JainTcapStack</I>
 * interface <B>must</B> be <I>jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.JainTcapStackImpl</I>.<P>
 *
 * Under the JAIN naming convention, the <B>upper-level package structure</B> (pathname)
 * can be used to differentiate between proprietary implementations from different SS7 Vendors.
 * The pathname used by each SS7 Vendor <B>must be</B> the domain name assigned
 * to the Vendor in reverse order, e.g. Sun Microsystem's would be 'com.sun' <P>
 *
 * It follows that a proprietary implementation of a JAIN SS7 Object can be located
 * at: <BR>
 * <I>'pathname'.'lower-level package structure and classname'</I><P>
 * <B>Where:</B><P>
 * <I>pathname</I> = reverse domain name, e.g.  com.sun'<P>
 * <I>lower-level package structure and classname</I> = mandated naming convention for the JAIN SS7
 * Object in question<P>
 * e.g. <I>jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.JainTcapStackImpl</I> is the mandated naming convention
 * for <I>jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.JainTcapStack</I>.<P>
 * The resulting Peer JAIN SS7 Object would be located at: <I><B>com.sun</B>.jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.JainTcapStackImpl</I><BR>
 *
 * Because the space of domain names is managed, this scheme ensures that collisions
 * between two different vendor's implementations will not happen. For example: a
 * different Vendor with a domain name 'foo.com' would have their Peer JainTcapStack Object
 * located at <I><B>com.foo</B>.jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.JainTcapStackImpl</I>.<BR>
 * This is a similar concept to the JAVA conventions used for managing package names.<P>
 *
 * The pathname is defaulted to 'com.sun' but may be set using the
 * <a href="#setPathName()">setPathName()</a> method. This allows a JAIN application
 * to switch between different Vendor implementations, as well as providing the
 * capability to use the default or current pathname.<P>
 *
 * The JAIN SS7 Factory is a <B>Singleton</B> class. This means that there will
 * only be one instance of the class with a global point of access to it. The single
 * instance of the JAIN SS7 Factory can be obtained using the
 * <a href="#getInstance()">getInstance()</a> method.
 * In this way, the JAIN SS7 Factory can acts a single point obtaining JAIN SS7 Objects.
