/**
 *  An event representing a TCAP Unidirectional Request dialogue primitive. This
 *  event will be passed from the Listener (the TC User) to the Provider (TCAP)
 *  to trigger the sending of components to the destination node when no reply
 *  is expected. This primitive is used when there is no need to establish a
 *  transaction with another peer TC User. <BR>
 *  The mandatory parameters of this primitive are supplied to the constructor.
 *  Optional parameters may then be set using the set methods. <p>
 *
 *  The optional parameters 'Application Context Name' and 'User Information'
 *  are centrally located in the Dialogue Portion class, therefore to manipulate
 *  them it is necessary to instantiate the Dialogue Portion Object and use the
 *  accessors method for the two parameters in that Dialogue Portion Object.
