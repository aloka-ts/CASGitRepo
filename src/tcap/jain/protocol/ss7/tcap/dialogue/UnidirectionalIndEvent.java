/**
 *  An event representing a TCAP Unidirectional indication dialogue primitive.
 *  This event will be passed from the Provider (TCAP) to the Listener(the TC
 *  User) to indicate the receipt of a TCAP message from an Unstructured
 *  dialogue (a dialogue between two TC Users with no explicit association
 *  between them). <BR>
 *  The mandatory parameters of this primitive are supplied to the constructor.
 *  Optional parameters may then be set using the set methods. <p>
 *
 *  The optional parameters 'Application Context Name' and 'User Information'
 *  are centrally located in the Dialogue Portion class, therefore to manipulate
 *  them it is necessary it instantiate the Dialogue Portion Object and use the
 *  accessors method for the two parameters in that Dialogue Portion Object. A
 *  Uni Indication event is the only Dialogue Indication Event that does not use
 *  a Dialogue Id within the supported variants. However for the JAIN TCAP API
 *  specification the Dialogue Id will be included to associate Component Events
 *  with this Dialogue Event, hence simplifying the implementation of a JAIN
 *  TCAP application.
