/**
 *  This interface defines the methods required by all TCAP user applications to
 *  receive and process JAIN TCAP Events that are emitted by an object
 *  implementing the <a href="JainTcapProvider.html">JainTcapProvider</a>
 *  interface. It must be noted that any object that implements the:
 *  <UL>
 *    <LI> JainTcapListener Interface is referred to as JainTcapListenerImpl.
 *    <LI> JainTcapProvider Interface is referred to as JainTcapProviderImpl.
 *  </UL>
 *  The Events emitted by a JainTcapProviderImpl may be one of two types:
 *  <UL>
 *    <LI> <a href="ComponentIndEvent.html">Component Indication Events</a> -
 *    these are component indication primitives emitted as events by the
 *    JainTcapProviderImpl. Component Indication Events represent TCAP
 *    Components that are sent from TCAP to the TCAP User.
 *    <LI> <a href="DialogueIndEvent.html">Dialogue Indication Events</a> -
 *    these are dialogue handling indication primitives emitted as events by the
 *    JainTcapProviderImpl. Dialogue Indication Events represent TCAP Dialogue
 *    handling primitives that are sent from TCAP to the TCAP User.
 *  </UL>
 *  <p>
 *
 *  A TCAP User application will only receive Dialogue and Component handling
 *  indication Events once it has registered as an EventListener of a
 *  JainTcapProviderImpl. The User application will register with the
 *  JainTcapProviderImpl with an User Address by invoking the ProviderImpl's <a
 *  href="JainTcapProvider.html#addJainTcapListener(jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.JainTcapListener,
 *  , jain.address.JainAddress)">addJainTcapListener() method</a>
 *  . Any Events addressed to a User Address belonging to an User Application
 *  will be passed to that User application. <p>
 *
 *  The User application will use the JainTcapProviderImpl to send TCAP messages
 *  by sending <a href="DialogueReqEvent.html">Dialogue Request Events</a> and
 *  <a href="ComponentReqEvent.html">Component Request Events</a> to that
 *  JainTcapProviderImpl. These Events will be handled by the
 *  JainTcapProviderImpl's <a href="JainTcapProvider.html#sendComponentReqEvent(jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.ComponentReqEvent)">
 *  sendComponentReqEvent()</a> and <a href="JainTcapProvider.html#sendDialogueReqEvent(jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.DialogueReqEvent)">
 *  sendDialogueReqEvent()</a> methods. The User application must send <a
 *  href="DialogueReqEvent.html">Dialogue Request Events</a> with the same
 *  Dialogue Id to the same JainTcapProviderImpl.
