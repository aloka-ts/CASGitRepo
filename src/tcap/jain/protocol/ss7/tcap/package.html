<body text="#000000" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#FF0000" vlink="#800080" alink="#0000FF">This package contains the main interfaces
required to represent JAIN TCAP protocol
stacks, JAIN TCAP applications, as well as
the Classes and Exceptions needed to send
and receive JAIN TCAP primitives. The implementation
of the two stack vendor specific interfaces,
namely JainTcapStack and JainTcapProvider
will be vendor specific, however the naming
of these proprietory implementations is mandated.
The class name of the vendor specific implementations
must be the JAIN TCAP &quot;InterfaceName&quot;
of which that class implements with &quot;Impl&quot;
appended to the end of it. For example a
vendor implementation of the JainTcapStack
Interface must be called &quot;JainTcapStackImpl&quot;.
Therefore once each vendor has implemented
the JAIN TCAP API specification they must
has two proprietary classes called JainTcapStackImpl.class
and JainTcapProviderImpl.class. The characteristics
of the three main interfaces are listed below:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="JainTcapStack.html">JainTcapStack</a>: This Interface defines
the minimial management properties that enables the JAIN TCAP API specification
to operate independently of the JAIN OAM API Specification. Therefore the
JainTcapStack Object is a representation of the main management functionality
of the TCAP layer, as well as the central point for the creation of JainTcapProviders.
From within the JainTcapStack Object it is possible for any application
to get a list of JainTcapProvider objects that are attached to the underlying
JainTcapStack by using the <a href="JainTcapStack.html#getProviderList()">getProviderList</a>
method with the JainTcapStack Object. This method returns an ArrayList
of JainTcapProvider references of which a JainTcapListener Object may register.
Similiarly if the JainTcapStack Object has no JainTcapProviders attached
to it, the JainTcapListener may use the <a href="JainTcapStack.html#createProvider()">createProvider method</a> to create a new JainTcapProvider object.<br>
<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
<a href="JainTcapProvider.html">JainTcapProvider</a>: This Interface defines the methods for
  adding JainTcapListeners to, and removing
  JainTcapListeners from a list of registered
  JainTcapListeners held within the JainTcapProvider.
  The JainTcapListener registers with a JainTcapProvider
  with a <a href="JainAddress.html">User Address</a>, this is explained in more detail in the definition of a <a href="JainTcapListener.html">JainTcapListener</a>
below. Other methods defined within the JainTcapProvider provide the functionality
for a JainTcapListener to obtain a Dialogue with another JainTcapListener
based on a Dialogue Id. The JainTcapProvider also defines the functionality
to obtain Invoke Id's based on a specific Dialogue Id, that enables a JainTcapListener
to Invoke operations on another JainTcapListener to which a Dialogue has
been initiated. In order for communication to take place between a local
JainTcapListener and a remote JainTcapListener, the local JainTcapListener
must send a number of <a href="ComponentReqEvent.html">Component Request
Events</a> interspersed by <a href="DialogueReqEvent.html">Dialogue Request
Events</a> to it's associated JainTcapProvider. The
  Jain User Address of the remote JainTcapListener
  should be set in the appropriate Dialogue
  Request Events.<br>
<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
<a href="JainTcapListener.html">JainTcapListener</a>: This Interface defines
the methods required by all JainTcapListeners to receive and process Events
that are emitted by a JainTcapProvider. A remote JainTcapProvider which
receives Component Indications and a Dialogue Indication (which were sent
by the local JainTcapListener) out of the TCAP layer of its SS7 protocol
stack, encapsulates them as Events and passes them to the remote JainTcapListener.
As mentioned above this occurs by Event passing, were the remote JainTcapProvider
invokes the <a href="JainTcapListener.html#processComponentIndEvent(jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.ComponentIndEvent)">processComponentIndEvent</a>
and <a href="JainTcapListener.html#processDialogueIndEvent(jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.DialogueIndEvent)">processDialogueIndEvent</a> as appropriate and passes the relevant Event
  within the method to the remote JainTcapListener.
  The same process occurs when the local JainTcapProvider
  passes Indication Events (received from the
  remote JainTcapListener) to the local JainTcapListener.<br>
<BR><ul>
<li>A JainTcapListener registers with a JainTcapProvider
    to become an Event Listener of that JainTcapProvider,
    it registers with an object reference to
    itself and its Jain User Address. These two
    values are stored by the JainTcapProvider
    and the Jain User Address is used as a lookup
    to obtain an object reference to a specific
    JainTcapListener. The Jain User Address is
    used for the routing of Tcap messages between
    various local and remote JainTcapListeners.&nbsp;<br>
<BR></li>

<li>A JainTcapListener may have multiple Tcap
    User Addresses, which enables it to operate
    over a number of Sub-Systems, however the
    JainTcapListener may only register with a
    JainTcapProvider, with only one Tcap User
    Address at any specific time. For example
    if a specific JainTcapListenerImpl (application
    developer specific implementation of the
    JainTcapListener interface), which operates
    over two Jain User Addresses, wants to register
    itself for both tcap User Adresses with the
    same JainTcapProviderImpl (vendor specific
    implementation of the JainTcapProvider interface),
    then the JainTcapListenerImpl will have to
    invoke the <a href="JainTcapProvider.html#addJainTcapListener(jain.protocol.ss7.tcap.JainTcapListener, jain.address.JainAddress)">addJainTcapListener</a> method within the JainTcapProviderImpl twice,
    once for each Jain User Address.&nbsp; <br></li>

<li>The Jain User Address methods defined within
    the JainTcapListener interface, provide the
    functionality that enables the JainTcapListenerImpl
    to manipulate and maintain the list of Tcap
    User Addresses it supports.</li>
</ul></li>


</ul>
<b>Note:</b>
<p>&nbsp;The cardinality of the relationship
between JainTcapListeners and JainTcapProviders
is not restricted in any way. The restriction
of this cardinality is dependent on a vendors
specific implementation of the JAIN TCAP
API, were the necessary exceptions are thrown
if the specificied cardinality is violated.
However it is mandated that there may only
be one JainTcapStack Object for the TCAP
Layer of an SS7 protocol stack.</body>
