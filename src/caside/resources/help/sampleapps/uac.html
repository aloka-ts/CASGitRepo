<h2><a name="_Toc133742250">User Agent Client (UAC)</a><o:p></o:p></h2>




<p class="bodytext"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The UAC is an application that initiates up to six feasible SIP requests to a UAS.</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">This
sample application sends INVITE request to a UAS ( that can be
configured) when UAC starts. It has a load-on-startup feature enabled.
As soon as its is activated it sends the INVITE request. When 200 OK is
recieved from the UAS it sends ACK and thus a Dialog is established.
This dialog is terminated when BYE request is recieved from the UAS
(Thsi time UAS is behaving like UAC). UAC (This time UAC behaves like
UAS) sends 200 response after recieving BYE.</span></p>
